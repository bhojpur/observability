### Monitoring-satellite

Monitoring-satellite is composed by a set of components responsible for collecting and pushing observability signals from a Kubernetes cluster to a remote location (usually monitoring-central) while also being responsible for the alerting evaluation and alert routing.

#### Components

* [Alertmanager](https://github.com/prometheus/alertmanager)
* [Grafana](https://github.com/grafana/grafana)
* [Kube-State-Metrics](https://github.com/kubernetes/kube-state-metrics)
* [Node-exporter](https://github.com/prometheus/node_exporter)
* [Prometheus](https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus)
* [Prometheus-Operator](https://github.com/prometheus-operator/prometheus-operator)
* [OpenTelemetry-Collector](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector) (If tracing support is enabled)

The monitoring-satellite's components can be customized by setting up different values for several Jsonnet external-variables. Some of those external variables are required (even if left empty), and other can become required depending on the values of other variables. The complete list can be seen below:

| External Variable          	| Required                                                                              	| Description                                                                                                                                                    	|

Therefore, the simplest command that can be used to generate monitoring-satellite manifests would be:
```bash
jsonnet -c -J vendor -m monitoring-satellite/manifests \
--ext-str namespace="monitoring-satellite" \
--ext-str cluster_name="my-cluster" \
--ext-str alerting_enabled="false" \
--ext-str node_affinity_label='' \
--ext-str is_preview="false" \
--ext-str remote_write_enabled="false" \
--ext-str tracing_enabled="false" \
monitoring-satellite/manifests/yaml-generator.jsonnet | xargs -I{} sh -c 'cat {} | gojsontoyaml > {}.yaml' -- {}
```

### Monitoring-central

#### Components

* [Grafana](https://github.com/grafana/grafana)
* [VictoriaMetrics](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics) 

Monitoring-central is composed by a set of components responsible for receiving observability signals(usually from monitoring-satellite) and storing them for long term. At the same time, it provides a stable URL where one can access Grafana's UI with all datasources already configured.

The monitoring-central's components can be customized by setting up different values for several Jsonnet external-variables. Some of those external variables are required (even if left empty), and other can become required depending on the values of other variables. The complete list can be seen below:

| External Variable              	| Required 	| Description                                                                  	|
|--------------------------------	|----------	|------------------------------------------------------------------------------	|
| namespace                      	| Yes      	| Namespace where all components will be deployed.                             	|
| grafana_dns_name               	| Yes      	| DNS used to configure Grafanas's certificate and ingress.                    	|
| grafana_ingress_node_port      	| Yes      	| Port used by Grafana's ingress.                                              	|
| gcp_external_ip_address        	| Yes      	| Name of GCP static external-ip resource, used by Grafana's ingress.          	|
| IAP_client_id                  	| Yes      	| Identity Aware Proxy client ID used to create google managed authentication. 	|
| victoriametrics_dns_name       	| Yes      	| DNS used to configure VictoriaMetrics' certificate and ingress.              	|
| remote_write_username          	| Yes      	| Username required to authenticate against the remote-write endpoint.         	|
| remote_write_password          	| Yes      	| Password required to authenticate against the remote-write endpoint.         	|
| vmauth_auth_key                	| Yes      	| Random string used to protect VictoriaMetrics' reload and debug endpoints.   	|
| vmauth_gcp_external_ip_address 	| Yes      	| Name of GCP static external-ip resource, used by VictoriaMetrics's ingress.  	|

Therefore, the simplest command that can be used to generate monitoring-central manifests would be:
```bash
jsonnet -c -J vendor -m monitoring-central/manifests \
--ext-str namespace="monitoring-central" \
--ext-str grafana_dns_name="http://my.grafana.url" \
--ext-str grafana_ingress_node_port=32164 \
--ext-str gcp_external_ip_address="my_external_ip_address" \
--ext-str IAP_client_id="myIAP_ID" \
--ext-str IAP_client_secret="myIAP_secret" \
--ext-str victoriametrics_dns_name="http://my.victoriametrics.url" \
--ext-str vmauth_auth_key="random-key" \
--ext-str remote_write_password="password" \
--ext-str remote_write_username="user" \
--ext-str vmauth_gcp_external_ip_address="my_other_external_ip_address" \
monitoring-central/manifests/yaml-generator.jsonnet | xargs -I{} sh -c 'cat {} | gojsontoyaml > {}.yaml' -- {}
```
